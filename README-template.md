## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned
I learned more about positioning elements using css to build the required layout.

### Continued development

I'm learning more about using padding and margin and calculating the amount of space so as to build the required layout as shown in the design


### Useful resources

- [w3School](https://www.w3schools.com/) - Their tutorial on css has helped me alot on how to style elements and positioning them as how they are in the design
